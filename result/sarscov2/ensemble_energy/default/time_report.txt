mkdir -p failed for path /pjmhome/.config/matplotlib: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/pjmhome/.config'
Matplotlib created a temporary cache directory at /tmp/matplotlib-wa6mau4w because there was an issue with the default path (/pjmhome/.config/matplotlib); it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
